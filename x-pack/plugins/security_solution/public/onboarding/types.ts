   * To specify capabilities in an OR fashion, they can be defined in a single level array like: `capabilities: [cap1, cap2]`.
   * If either of "cap1 || cap2" is granted the card will be included.

   * To specify capabilities with AND conditional, use a second level array: `capabilities: [['cap1', 'cap2']]`.
   * This would result in the boolean expression "cap1 && cap2", both capabilities must be granted to include the card.
   *
   * They can also be combined like: `capabilities: ['cap1', ['cap2', 'cap3']]` which would result in the boolean expression "cap1 || (cap2 && cap3)".
